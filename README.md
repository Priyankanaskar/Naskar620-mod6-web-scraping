# P6: Web Scraping, NLP (Requests, BeautifulSoup, and spaCy) & Engage
## Project - Web Scraping and NLP
### Objectives
This exercise is used to practice web scraping (fetching and extracting information) and processing the content from a web page. 

### Module : 6 
### Author: Priyanka Naskar
### Github: https://github.com/Priyankanaskar/Naskar620-mod6-web-scraping
Date:   11/25/2024
See [BeautifulSoup Quickstart Guide](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#quick-start)

Choose a BeautifulSoup parser:

- 'html.parser' (default, you get this with BeautifulSoup)
- 'html5lib' (install separately if desired)

### Getting Started

Fork (copy into your GitHub account) and clone down (to your machine) this repo to get started with web scraping.
### Task 1. Get Started
Copy the base repository into your GitHub account by selecting the "Use this Template" button on GitHub and specifying yourself as the owner.  The base repository is available at: https://github.com/wmnlp-materials/web-scrapingLinks to an external site.
Clone YOUR new repo down to your machine.
NOTE: If you already have a project folder on your machine from this repo: https://github.com/denisecase/620-mod6-web-scrapingLinks to an external site. You can just move the notebook from the base repository into that folder and reuse the .venv you're already working on. 

### Task 2. Open Notebook and Complete Tasks 
1. On your machine, open the Jupyter Notebook for editing. 
2. Required: In your Markdown introduction, add a viewable, clickable link to    your GitHub repo after your name. 
3. Build your brand and make your Markdown introduction clear and professional. 
4. Required: Use Markdown headings  (e.g. Question 1) to clearly show your content by each question number. 
5. Complete the first task.
6. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
7. Complete the second task.
8. Execute the notebook. Commit and push to GitHub. Verify your notebook appears correctly.
9. Work this way until all tasks have been completed. 
10. Add packages as needed if you are missing any. The following - or more - may be required:

beautifulsoup4
html5lib
ipykernel
jupyterlab
matplotlib
requests
spacy
spacytextblob

### Task 3. Export to HTML and Finalize Repo
Execute each notebook.
After executing, export each notebook to HTML.
Commit and push your HTML files to your GitHub repo along with the executed notebooks. 
Verify you have a professional README.md that introduces your GitHub repository and provides helpful information about your project.
